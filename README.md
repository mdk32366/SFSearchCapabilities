[Search for Files](https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=collab_files_searching.htm&type=5)

In Salesforce Classic and Lightning Experience, you can search for files from the header search field. Use feed search to find files posted in a specific Chatter feed, such as on a profile, on a record, or in a group.

In Salesforce Classic, you can also search for files using the Files search:

Optionally, click a filter on the sidebar to restrict your search to a specific set of files.
Enter your search terms in the Search field on the Files tab. You can search by file name, description, owner, type, or within the file's text.
Click Search to see a filtered list of all relevant files based on your search terms. Or click Clear search terms and options to clear your search terms.
In Lightning Experience, you can use the Files dropdown to see favorite and recent files.

Note
NOTE The feed search returns the matches for file or link names shared in posts, but not in comments. Files searches donâ€™t include:
Documents from the Documents tab in Salesforce Classic.
Attachments from Notes and Attachments related lists.
Search supports several file types and has file size limits. If a file exceeds the maximum size, the text within the file isn't searched, but the file's name, description, type, and owner are.
